# GoUnity
A portable Go library which represents API bindings that allow you to manage Unity XT storage platforms.

2. Populate the properties file with values from your Unity XT system as shown below:

3. To run the integration tests, run `make go-unittest`. Once all the tests in each module are run successfully, you will see `Output` as `PASS` for each of the module else `Output` is `FAIL`.
4. To get the integration test coverage for each module, run `make go-coverage`.
5. To generate and analyze coverage statistics, run `go tool cover -html=gounity_coverprofile.out`.
